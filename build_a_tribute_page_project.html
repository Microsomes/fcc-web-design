        <h3 id="headline">Fusajiro Yamauchi life Before Nintendo:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1859</strong> - Born in Kyoto, Japan</li>
          <li>
            <strong>1889</strong> - Fusajiro Yamauchi opened the first Hanafuda 
            (flower cards) card shop called "Nintendo Karuta", 
            during a time when the Japanese government was banning playing cards from the hands of the public, 
            due to them being tied to gambling, with the exception of Yamauchi's playing cards.
            With the huge success he had in selling these cards, 
            he rapidly began expanding and opened another card shop in Osaka. He later went on to create more card games.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1940</strong> - Fusajiro departed from the company in 1929, leaving his son-in-law Sekiryo Kaneda (whose name had changed to Sekiryo Yamauchi) in charge of the company. 
            Fusajiro remained uninvolved in the business for the remainder of his life until he died of a stroke on January 1st, 
            1940. Fusajiro's great-grandson, 
            Hiroshi Yamauchi, took over Nintendo in September 1949 and ran the company for 53 years, 
            transforming it from a card game company into a multibillion-dollar video gaming company and global conglomerate.

            only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says
            that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been
            genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long
